## Timeout
# TIMEOUT_QUEUE_AND_POLL sets the timeout for the queue
# -t <requestTimeout:responseTimeout> , sets request and response timeout for the queue
# if not set the default value is 10:10  (10 seconds) and (10 seconds) - these are not good for production settings,
# especially if one is expecting larger execution times on the opal server the repsoneTimeout should be set higher
# requestTimeout is the time after which the poll thread gets rejected if there is nothing in the queue
# responseTimeout is the time after which the request sender gets a timeout if there is no response for the query
# A responseTimeout of 604800 seconds = 7 days

TIMEOUT_QUEUE_AND_POLL=100:604800

## Allowed Ips
# If the ALLOWED_IPS is not set the queue server is open to all ip addresses, to make the mechanism safer restrict the queue to certain ip adresses,
# Set the allowed ip adresses by setting ALLOWED_IPS to <ipadress>,<ipadress>
# note, that the allowed ip addresses should at least include your poll server ip address and one R client server ip address for the q-p
# to function.
